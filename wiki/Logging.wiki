#summary Using logging in zkbase

= Introduction =

ZKBase supports logging by using [http://logging.apache.org/log4j/ log4j].

*Note:* The configuration is heavily inspired by [http://appfuse.org/display/APF/Home Appfuse].

= Usage =

To create a logger as member variable, use the following code (or similar):
{{{
    private final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());
}}}

Now, the logger can be used, e.g.:
{{{
	log.info("Adding user");
}}}

As default, the log is appended to the console (see configuration for details).
